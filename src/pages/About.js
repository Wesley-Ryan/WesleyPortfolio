          I'm a Fullstack developer who is passionate about privacy and making
          the Internet cool again. I specialize in all things JavaScript but
          most of my time is spent in React or Node/Express. However I am
          proficient in technologies across the entire Stack including SQL and
          NoSQL databases. I am currently looking for new career opportunities
          where I have the ability to provide meaningful impact to the project
          and grow in my career.
